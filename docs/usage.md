# ccteam User Manual

**ccteam turns the coding agents you already run (Claude Code, Codex, Grok, Kimi, DSH…) into one team — any session can spawn, dispatch, and collect work from any vendor on any machine, while you steer it all from Telegram, Lark, or a browser tab.**

Install once, start one resident process, then do daily work from three surfaces, listed in recommended order:

| Surface | Best for | Section |
|---|---|---|
| **Web console** | Create projects, start sessions, install plugins, configure IM, inspect status - the easiest default path | [1. Web console](#1-web-console-recommended) |
| **Telegram / Lark** | Mobile control, file exchange, tool approvals | [2. Telegram / Lark](#2-telegram--lark) |
| **CLI** | Scripts, ops, advanced headless use | [3. CLI](#3-cli-advanced) |

---

## Core Concepts

- **chat** = one conversation surface: one web console tab, Telegram/Feishu DM, or group. Each chat has its own current project, current session, and session list. Chats are isolated from each other.
- **project** = a local code directory registered with a short slug.
- **session** = one independent agent conversation with its own context, like a native Claude Code session. A project can have many sessions running side by side. Each session has a durable handle `s<N>` that survives restarts and is never reused.
- **role** = an optional persona bound at session start, loaded from `.claude/agents/<role>.md`. The default is **roleless**: the bare vendor reads the project's own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. Personas are installed from the marketplace or written by you; ccteam seeds none.

> **ccteam only manages its own footprint.** It never edits your product code, `.git/`, `.env`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `AGENTS.md`. Project instructions stay owned by the project and are read natively by Claude and Codex.

---

## Before You Start: Install and Run the Service

These are the only terminal steps required. Afterward, the web console is the recommended surface.

### 1. Install

ccteam calls the Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, OpenCode, Kimi Code, DSH, and Pi CLIs already installed and authenticated on your machine. It does not bundle them.

**Install and authenticate at least one of them first** — a vendor that is missing, or installed but not authenticated, cannot host a session on that machine:

| Vendor | Install | Authenticate |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | [docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code) | `claude auth login` |
| Codex | [github.com/openai/codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) | `codex login` |
| Grok Build | [docs.x.ai/build/overview](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview) | `grok login` |
| OpenCode | [opencode.ai](https://opencode.ai) | `opencode auth login` |
| Kimi Code | [moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/) | `kimi login` |
| DSH | [npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh) | `npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`; DSH sessions and DSH Web use `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` when set, otherwise the identity's DSH Settings → Models config |
| Pi | [pi.dev](https://pi.dev/) | provider API key, verified with `pi auth check --provider <provider>` |

**1 · Let an agent do it**

Paste into any agent you already have:

> Install https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam — follow `INSTALL.md` in the repo.

**2 · From source** — recommended; requires Rust + Node.js (for the web console bundle):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam && cd ccteam
make install
```

**3 · One-click script** — prebuilt binary, no toolchain required:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firstintent/ccteam/main/install.sh | sh
```

Then verify:

```bash
ccteam --version
claude --version   # optional; only needed for Claude sessions
codex --version    # optional; only needed for Codex sessions
grok --version     # optional; only needed for Grok Build sessions
opencode --version # optional; only needed for OpenCode sessions
kimi --version     # optional; only needed for Kimi Code sessions (`kimi login` first)
dsh --version      # optional; only needed for DSH sessions (0.1.0-rc.6 or newer)
pi --version       # optional; only needed for Pi sessions (0.83.0 or newer)
```

> If `ccteam` is not found, add `~/.local/bin` to PATH: `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`, then reopen your shell.

**Where it lands.** One ladder decides the destination for every install mode — the script, `make install`, and `ccteam update` all use it, so you never end up with two `ccteam` binaries disagreeing: an explicit `CCTEAM_INSTALL_DIR` wins, otherwise the directory where `ccteam` already lives (an upgrade replaces the copy you are running, symlinks resolved), otherwise `~/.local/bin`. After installing, the script names any *other* `ccteam` still on your PATH — it only reports, never deletes — because a copy earlier on PATH is what makes an upgrade look like it did nothing.

### 2. The Daemon

`make install` (and the one-click script, when it detects an upgrade) already started the daemon with **`ccteam daemon start`**: one resident process (web console + IM gateway + standard resource API + MCP socket), detached with `setsid` so it survives your shell closing and SSH disconnects. This is the single supervision mechanism on Linux, macOS, and WSL — **there is no systemd or launchd unit anymore** (retired in v0.9.7). Manage it the same way on every platform:

```bash
ccteam daemon status     # pid · ready · running-vs-binary version   (add --json for scripts)
ccteam daemon logs -f    # follow ~/.ccteam/daemon.log
ccteam daemon restart    # graceful SIGTERM stop + re-detach (also `make daemon-restart`)
ccteam daemon stop       # graceful stop; agent processes are never killed — see "What a daemon restart does to live sessions" below
```

Honest tradeoff: with no OS supervisor there is **no crash-restart and no auto-start at boot** — after a reboot, run `ccteam daemon start` again (`ccteam status` / `ccteam doctor` show a down daemon at a glance; a `@reboot ccteam daemon start` cron line covers boot-start if you want it). Uninstall with `make uninstall` (source) or `install.sh --uninstall` (prebuilt) — both stop the daemon and remove the binary but keep `~/.ccteam`.

**Upgrading from a pre-v0.9.7 install (systemd/launchd):** just re-run the installer or `ccteam daemon start` once — its one-time takeover disables and removes the old ccteam service unit and brings the daemon back up self-managed. A unit you wrote by hand is left untouched (ccteam reports that instance as "not managed" and won't stop it — use your own supervisor). See [Updating](#updating) for the ongoing path.

Without detaching at all (dev / containers / your own supervisor's `ExecStart`), `ccteam start` still runs in the foreground.

`make install`, and `ccteam status` at any time, print the web console URL, for example:

```text
web url:   http://<your-lan-ip>:7331/?token=ccteam:<token>
```

Open that link to enter the console.

---

## 1. Web Console (Recommended)

Open the link printed by `ccteam start`. The console is a chat-style UI with a **collapsible sidebar** (search with ⌘K, New session, Workflow, session list) and **no full-width top bar**. Cost and the avatar menu live in the sidebar footer. **Workflow** covers Skills / Roles / Marketplace / MCP / Evolution (read-only). **Settings** has Ops overview (daemon health, plus a management card per host: its full vendor inventory — installed / version / readiness / whether the ccteam tools are registered — with register and import buttons offered only where the backend will actually accept the write, remediation hints verbatim, and that machine's reported projects with their adopt state; fleet observation lives on the Team page), Access (external-agent MCP config, developer REST API, satellite join, IM credentials — the admin manages the global bot, regular users configure their own; user login links stay admin-only), General, and Account (with self-serve token reset for every identity). Only the Users (admin) tab is admin-exclusive. Theme defaults to **light** (dark remains available).

> **Access and security:** by default the web server binds to `0.0.0.0:7331` and uses token auth. The token is stored at `~/.ccteam/secrets/web-token`. The web console has **no TLS** and transmits plaintext; use it only on a trusted LAN, and do not expose it to the public internet. For a stricter local-only mode: `ccteam start --web-bind 127.0.0.1:7331` (tokenless local bind). DSH Web uses a companion listener on the web port + 1 by default; use `--dsh-web-bind <addr:port>` to choose it or `--dsh-web-bind off` to disable it while keeping `/api/v1/dsh/status` readable.

### Register MCP (Automatic)

Every `ccteam daemon start` (and foreground `ccteam start`) automatically registers ccteam's own tools (session spawning/dispatch, file sending, and related controls) into the configuration of **every installed vendor whose config ccteam may write** — Claude (`~/.claude.json`), Codex (`~/.codex/config.toml`), Grok (`~/.grok/config.toml`), OpenCode (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`), Kimi (`~/.kimi-code/mcp.json`) — so a plain session of those vendors can orchestrate the team (`grok mcp doctor` verifies the Grok side). The entry carries a **user-scoped enrollment credential** — it says whose the config is and nothing more; the per-process identity is issued by the daemon when that vendor's session connects, so two agents started an hour apart from the same config are two callers with their own ledger rows. The write is idempotent and merge-only (your other MCP servers are untouched), vendors that are not installed are skipped, and an entry left over from an older ccteam (a `Bearer ccteam:<hex>` admin token, or a `command`-style stdio entry) reads as *not registered* and is replaced on the next start.

**DSH is deliberately not on that config-writer list** because it has no equivalent global MCP file. Hiring DSH from ccteam needs no plugin installation: `/new dsh`, the DSH page, or `session_spawn {vendor:"dsh", ...}` connects into that identity's one DSH web runtime — the same space the **DSH** menu shows (regular users: `$CCTEAM_HOME/runtime/dsh/web/<user>/`; owner: real `~/.dsh`) — so hired sessions appear live in the DSH sidebar, grouped under the project's workspace, cold-resume by sid, and track raw token usage. ccteam preloads its `@ccteam/dsh-client` plugin in the runtimes it manages; for a `dsh web` you started yourself, register the plugin from the **Hosts** page (or `dsh plugin --profile web add @ccteam/dsh-client`) and restart that instance. A DSH session of your own can also orchestrate the team: paste the daemon URL (default `http://127.0.0.1:7331`) and an enrollment credential from **Settings → Access** into DSH Settings — it gets the same eight tools, and if it has not been bound to a ccteam project yet, its first tool call asks for a project slug and remembers it.

**Pi is also deliberately not on the config-writer list**: its managed sessions receive the team tools through a ccteam-owned bridge extension loaded at spawn, so no Pi config of yours is ever written — and a `pi` you start by hand in a shell has no ccteam tools. To re-register the config-writable vendors manually — say, after hand-editing a vendor config — use `ccteam config mcp` or the **Register ccteam MCP** button on the **Hosts** page, which also reports which vendors are installed, their versions, and readiness.

### DSH Web

The **DSH** page embeds native DeepSeek Harness Web through the companion listener. It uses the same ccteam login cookie as the rest of the console; the DSH process never receives the ccteam cookie or bearer token.

An identity runs **one** DSH runtime, and ccteam is its second client: sessions you hire from ccteam (`/new dsh`, `session_spawn`) are created inside that same runtime, so they show up live in this page's sidebar under the project's workspace, you can open one mid-task to watch or interject, and the agent's next dispatch continues the same conversation. A hire joins one of DSH's four agent presets — `standard`, `ptc`, `minimal`, or `creator` — which pick its toolset; ccteam defaults to `standard`, `mode=` on `/new dsh` (or `mode` on the spawn APIs) picks another, and a hire runs on the `danger-full-access` permission preset (full file access, no approval prompts) unless spawned with `hitl`.

- **Owner:** ccteam uses the real `~/.dsh` space. If a native `dsh web` is already running on `127.0.0.1:3080`, ccteam attaches to it instead of starting a second writer — hired sessions then need the ccteam plugin in that instance (one-click register on the **Hosts** page, then restart it yourself; ccteam never restarts a process it did not start). If nothing is running, ccteam starts one on an ephemeral loopback port with the plugin registered. A local browser can open the native URL directly; a LAN browser uses the ccteam proxy.
- **Regular users:** each identity gets `$CCTEAM_HOME/runtime/dsh/web/<user>/` with the DSH base app and `@ccteam/dsh-client` present; DSH sessions hired from ccteam live in this same home, so they appear in the DSH page. The profile is merge-style: DSH plugins the user installs stay in place, and ccteam's plugin materialization self-heals on each start. The first start works out of the box when this machine already has a DSH login: ccteam seeds the identity's DSH config files from the machine's DSH home and follows those bytes while the user has not changed them.
- **Model keys:** configure your own provider in native DSH **Settings → Models**. Every DSH session for the same identity — the ones you open here and the ones hired from inside ccteam — runs in the same runtime on the same config, so a change applies to all of them together. ccteam copies and hashes the DSH config files as bytes; it does not parse vendor YAML.
- **Ledger:** native DSH Web turns are not ccteam sessions, so they do not show up as `$0` or any other fake value in the ccteam ledger. The same rule holds inside a hired session: turns you type into it from the DSH side are vendor-native — ccteam's transcript and ledger record only the turns ccteam routed, and the DSH home keeps the complete conversation. Work delegated from DSH through the ccteam plugin is recorded normally.
- **Trust boundary:** tenant DSH Web is same-OS-user isolation. DSH agents can run shell commands, and self-installed DSH plugins are arbitrary npm code with the same trust level as that OS account. Sharing one OS user means config visibility is a convenience boundary, not a hard security boundary.
- **Plain-HTTP LAN access:** DSH Web is written for a loopback origin, where browsers grant it secure-context APIs — it mints every RPC id with `crypto.randomUUID`, which browsers withhold from plain HTTP on a LAN address. Because ccteam is what moves the UI off loopback, the companion listener restores that one API (a real `crypto.getRandomValues`-backed UUID v4) in the HTML it serves, and stays out of the way when the browser already provides it. Serving the console over HTTPS or opening it on the daemon host needs none of this.

When running ccteam behind HTTPS, proxy the DSH companion listener as well as the main web listener. DSH Web has no base-path support, so use a second HTTPS port or subdomain; proxying only `:7331` leaves the iframe on plain HTTP and browsers block it as mixed content.

### Create a Project

In the new-session dialog, choose **+ New project...**, enter a slug and directory path, and ccteam registers that directory as a project. If the same slug already exists, ccteam appends a number such as `demo2` or `demo3`.

Managing one afterwards happens where the project lives: hover its workspace header in the sidebar and open the **⋯** menu — start a session in it, copy its path, or **remove it from ccteam**. Removal asks you to type the slug, then the daemon retires the project atomically: it writes a durable tombstone first, stops and joins every session of that project, clears its progress state, and only then drops the catalog row. The directory on disk and your code are untouched. A retired slug is never reused — re-adding the same directory gets the next numeric slug (`demo2`). (Same semantics as `ccteam project rm` and `DELETE /api/v1/projects/{slug}`; both need a live daemon.)

### Start, Switch, and Drive Sessions

- **New session:** choose a vendor (Claude / Codex / Grok / OpenCode / Kimi / DSH / Pi) and protocol (stream-json or terminal for Claude, ACP for Grok, OpenCode, Kimi and DSH, Pi's own RPC for Pi), the model and reasoning effort, and HITL at spawn time. Both menus are built per vendor from what that vendor declared at its last handshake (`GET /api/v1/models`), so you pick from its own ids and its own levels — a vendor that has no effort axis shows no effort menu, and leaving either on **default** sends nothing and lets the vendor decide. The execution host is the project's — sessions run wherever their project is bound, and every session row wears a vendor chip. Roles come from the project's `.claude/agents/` — pick one at spawn time or launch roleless; Grok, OpenCode, Kimi, and DSH are roleless-only today. The session gets a handle like `s1`.
- **Each session** has **Chat | Terminal** tabs. Chat renders assistant output as Markdown, including headings, lists, tables, and code blocks with copy buttons. Press **Enter** to send, **Shift+Enter** for a newline, and stop an in-flight turn from the UI.
- **Dedicated session page:** `/app/chat/s/<sid>` is a clean view for one session. It has that session's history and session-filtered live events, without mixing other sessions.
- **Terminal tab:** a byte-faithful mirror of the session screen, including ANSI, cursor, and alignment. Currently available for Claude sessions. Codex, Grok, OpenCode, Kimi, DSH, and Pi are chat-only (Grok / OpenCode / Kimi / DSH run over ACP and Pi over its own RPC, with no terminal mirror).
- **History and resume:** click **More history (N)** under the session list to expand stopped-but-not-destroyed sessions. Click any row to cold-resume it from disk `meta.json`. Stopped sessions, sessions from before a daemon restart, and `/use <sid>` from mobile all resume the same way. **Import historical session** can find native Claude sessions started outside ccteam (matched by working directory) and adopt them into ccteam while keeping the transcript.
- **Attach files and skills:** the composer's **＋** menu uploads files or photos (drag-and-drop and clipboard paste work too — attachments show as removable chips while they upload), and attaches skills from two sections: the **project's own skills** (`.agents/skills/`, with legacy `.claude/skills/` entities still read) and the user-level **global skill library** (`~/.ccteam/skills`, nested ids included; attaching is a per-message pointer and never copies anything into the project). Files and skills ride the message for **every vendor**: files land on disk and the turn carries their path for the agent to read (the same mechanism as sending a photo over Telegram); an attached skill adds a read-and-follow pointer to its `SKILL.md`, so it works even for vendors with no native skill loader. Files go to the project's `.ccteam/uploads/` (local-host projects; remote/satellite projects are politely rejected for now).
- **Schedule a message:** tap the **clock** on the composer to enter schedule mode. Enter **how many minutes and/or hours** from now (or tap chips `+15m` / `+30m` / `+1h` / `+2h`), or pick a **local-clock** datetime — the UI converts everything to a relative delay so browser timezone and daemon timezone never disagree. A preview shows the expected local send time. Type the text and send — the message joins a **queue above the input**, sorted by send time; cancel with **×**. At fire time the text is a normal user turn into that session. Schedule mode does not carry file/skill attachments. Caps: 20 pending per session, farthest **7 days** ahead. Failed deliveries stay in the queue (marked failed) for 24 hours so you can dismiss them.

> Every logged-in user gets the same features. What you can reach is decided by **who you are and which projects you own**, not by a smaller menu: you see your own projects and the sessions in them, and nothing of anyone else's. The one exception is **Settings → Admin** (creating users and managing the shared bot credentials), which stays with the owner.

### Team View: Topology and Charter

The **Team** page is the multi-vendor cockpit, two tabs:

- **Topology** — the live delegation tree across every project and host: one row per session with vendor chip, live model (live sessions report the model actually running), status dot, cost and turn count; per-vendor KPI chips (live count + spend, click to filter), a recent-dispatch ticker, and host badges when the graph spans machines. Every session is a **real link** — right-click / middle-click **打开 ↗** to open a parent and its delegate in separate browser tabs and watch a delegation from both sides. Selecting a row opens the detail panel (model, host, parent, depth, cost, live activity, recent turns).
- **Charter (分工)** — division-of-labor management: a **vendor roster grouped by host** (local first, online before offline; offline satellites start collapsed, show how long they've been gone — past 7 days the roster suggests cleanup — and carry a remove button; the host id is always shown, so two machines reporting the same OS hostname stay distinguishable; per vendor: installed/version/readiness with remediation hints, an update-available hint when the npm catalog knows a newer release, plus live sessions and spend — click a vendor card to jump to the topology filtered to that vendor) and the **charter editor** — the per-project `routing.md` your agents consult via the `status` tool. Pick a project, edit with markdown preview, save; when the project has no charter the global `~/.ccteam/routing.md` shows read-only with one-click "copy as draft" (the web writes only the project file; the global file's write path stays CLI/filesystem). Honest semantics hold: agents PULL the charter (advisory, never injected), and notes beyond ~4k chars are excerpted in `status` with a pointer to the full file.
- **Formation playbooks (编队起手)** — six cards on the charter tab (commander & crews, driver & advisor, cross review, bake-off, research triangulation, cost pyramid). 起手 jumps to the launcher with the vendor lineup prefilled — orchestration itself happens inside the session you spawn. The full catalog (plus overseer / standing-watch / many-machines) is in [orchestration.md](orchestration.md).

### Marketplace: Install Roles, Skills, and Workflows

The **Marketplace** page (under **Workflow**; the Skills tab opens first, and the project picker appears only for project-scoped types like agents) browses curated plugins from [ccteam-hub](https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam-hub). Official ccteam plugins are shown first, followed by tracked open-source sources such as [agency-agents](https://github.com/wshobson/agents) and [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). Open an item to preview its body, then install it. Agents (roles) install into the current project's `.claude/agents/`; **skills install into the user-level global library** `~/.ccteam/skills` — never into the project — and are attached per message from the composer. Installs verify sha256 and show status (skill status is computed against the library). After installing a role, switch to it from any surface with `/role <role>`.

### Configure Telegram / Lark

Open **Settings** and enter IM credentials:

- **Telegram:** paste the bot token, save it, then send the bot a message. The page polls and captures your chat id.
- **Lark/Feishu:** enter App ID, App Secret, region (Feishu China / Lark international), and allowed users.

Secrets are masked (`...last4`) and never returned in plaintext. **Restart the daemon after changing global IM credentials** because they are loaded at startup. The page will show `restart required`. Per-user IM bots are hot-reloaded; see [Multi-User](#multi-user).

Detailed bot setup is in [2. Telegram / Lark](#setup).

### Multi-User

One daemon can serve multiple users on one machine. This is **soft isolation** under one OS account: a UX boundary, not a security boundary.

- Admins can create users in **Settings -> User Management**. Each user receives a one-time personal login link and sees only their own projects and sessions.
- Each user can configure their own IM bot in **Settings → Access → My IM bot**: one guided card per platform (Telegram / Lark), each a numbered two-step flow — ① save that platform's credential with its own button, ② bind who the bot answers, with sender capture starting by itself right after the save, so the next action is never a guess. Saving one platform never touches the other's credential. Save validates the token and applies immediately without a daemon restart. That bot drives only that user's sessions. **Each bot token must be unique.**

### Status and Cost

- **Status** shows daemon health, live/idle session counts, per-session cost, and today's total cost / budget. The top-bar cost pill uses the same data.
- Cost is tracked separately by vendor. Claude / Codex / Grok use embedded tables when the model is known; **OpenCode and Pi use only vendor-reported USD** (or "—" when missing/zero — never another vendor's price table); **DSH reports raw tokens but has no USD price table yet**; **Kimi always shows "—"** (its ACP wire carries no usage/cost). A turn that fails part-way is still billed by the vendor, so its tokens and cost land on the ledger like any other turn — a failure never reads as free.

### Standard Resource API

The console is built on a token-authenticated HTTP API you can use directly:

- Interactive docs: `http://<host>:7331/api/docs` (Scalar). Machine-readable spec: `/api/v1/openapi.json`.
- Resources include `/api/v1/projects`, `.../projects/{slug}/sessions`, `/sessions/{sid}/{turn,events,stop,scheduled}`, `/marketplace`, `/status`, `/hosts`, `/capabilities`, and `/models` (per vendor: the models it declared at its last handshake with an `observed_at`, plus its reasoning-effort ladder — advisory discovery for filling in `model` / `effort` on a spawn, never an allowlist).
- Auth uses the same web token. Session endpoints require the daemon to be online.

### External agents over MCP (`POST /mcp`)

Any agent ccteam does not manage (your own script, a hand-started CLI, an agent on another machine) can call the daemon's MCP endpoint directly with an **enrollment credential** and get the same eight tools a managed session has:

```
POST http://<host>:7331/mcp
Authorization: Bearer ccteam-enroll:<id>:<secret>
Mcp-Session-Id: <the id the daemon returned at initialize>
```

- **The credential says whose the config is; the daemon issues the identity.** `initialize` answers with an `Mcp-Session-Id`, and that id is what makes *this process* a caller of its own: it gets a real session row in the ledger (`managed_by: external`), so the sessions it spawns hang under it in the delegation tree instead of appearing as roots. Every later request must carry both the credential and the id — the id alone is not a credential, and a binding only resolves for the credential that opened it. A stale id answers `404` telling you to re-`initialize`; `DELETE /mcp` ends the binding when you are done.
- **Two scopes.** Every `ccteam daemon start` writes a **user-scoped** credential into the vendor configs on that machine, so a hand-started Claude/Codex/Grok/OpenCode/Kimi already has the tools; DSH gets the same identity model after its `@ccteam/dsh-client` plugin is connected with a pasted enrollment credential. Because a user-scoped credential names no project, such a caller must pass `project` explicitly on its first `session_*` call, and only its owner's projects are accepted. A **project-scoped** credential is what the console's copy button hands out (Settings → Access, or `POST /api/v1/projects/{slug}/enroll`): pinned to one workspace, safe to paste on another machine, listed and revocable afterwards. The secret is shown once, at mint time.
- **Nothing is inferred.** No working directory, no peer address, no "most recent project": a caller with no basis for a project is refused and told which slugs it could name. Unknown and forbidden projects/sessions return the same error (anti-enumeration). Bearer-only: cookies and query tokens are never accepted, and a web console token — which authenticates `/api/v1/**` — is rejected here with a message naming the credential families this endpoint does take.

## 2. Telegram / Lark

After connecting IM, you can drive sessions, send files, and approve tools from your phone. The easiest setup is [Web console Settings](#configure-telegram--lark). You can also use the `ccteam config` menu or write the credentials file manually.

### Setup

**Telegram:** talk to `@BotFather`, run `/newbot`, and copy the token. Configure it one of three ways:

1. **Web** (recommended): paste the token in Settings and let the console capture chat id.
2. **CLI menu:** run `ccteam config`, choose the IM bot token option, validate the token, and capture chat id.
3. **Credentials file** at `~/.ccteam/secrets/im-credentials.json` (directory `0700`, file `0600`):

```json
{
  "telegram": {
    "bot_token": "123456:replace_me",
    "allowed_chat_ids": ["123456789"]
  }
}
```

`allowed_chat_ids` is the safety boundary **and the owner roster**. Only listed chats can reach the daemon, and a listed chat is served as the box **owner** — so keep it to your own chats. **Do not leave it empty in production.** To find a chat id, send the bot a message, then run `curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/getUpdates"` and look for `message.chat.id`.

**Feishu / Lark** can coexist with Telegram and uses native WebSocket long connection, with no public callback URL. In the developer console (Feishu: `open.feishu.cn`, Lark: `open.larksuite.com`), create an app, enable the bot, choose **WebSocket** event subscription, subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1`, grant `im:message` and `im:message:send_as_bot`, then copy App ID (`cli_...`) and App Secret. Configure through Web Settings / `ccteam config`, or add a `lark` block:

```json
{
  "lark": {
    "app_id": "cli_replace_me",
    "app_secret": "replace_me",
    "allowed_user_ids": ["ou_replace_me"],
    "use_feishu": true
  }
}
```

- `use_feishu`: `true` for Feishu (China), `false` for Lark international.
- `allowed_user_ids` is an open_id allowlist (`ou_...`) **and the owner roster**: a listed sender is served as the box owner. **Empty means reject everyone** (fail closed). To get your open_id, start with an empty list, message the bot, find `ignoring ou_xxxx (not in allowed_users)` in logs, and add that `ou_xxxx`.
- The `"*"` wildcard lets **anyone** message the bot. It names nobody, so nobody is served as the owner through it: every sender is a guest who owns only what it creates and sees no project. The daemon warns about this at startup — put your own `ou_...` in the list to take the bot back.

> Manual credentials file changes require daemon restart. The same applies to global credentials configured in Web Settings. Lark/Feishu and Telegram are peers: text, rich text, images, and files are supported.

### Gateway Commands

Telegram replies render a Markdown subset (bold/italic/code/fences/links/quotes/lists) as Telegram HTML and automatically fall back to plain text if Telegram rejects the markup.

Telegram also has a persistent quick-template keyboard. Send `/keys` to show the configured templates, tap one to arm its prefix for the next plain message, or send `/keys off` to remove the keyboard and discard an armed prefix. The default templates are Commander, Driver+advisor, Cross review, Bake-off, Triangulate, and Pyramid. The Commander template runs every top-level task as a pipeline: a read-only OpenCode GLM (`zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3-flash`) scout returns 2–5 pinned GitHub precedents (URL, commit/tag, path, license; exactly one Codex Luna scout fallback when no usable GLM session exists); Claude Fable writes the plan to `<project>/.ccteam/plans/<date>-<topic>.md` (every task carries id, implementer, dependencies, files, definition of done; changes after approval go to an Amendments section); Codex Sol gates the plan with a cap of two rounds and then advises implementers (mandatory before any deviation from the plan, advice not binding, disagreements escalate to the commander); Luna (at most 3 in parallel), Terra, Sonnet, and Haiku each work in their own git worktree and `task/<id>` branch; a Claude Sonnet git agent merges the branches into `integration/<topic>`, runs the project's full checks, resolves conflicts, opens the PR and merges into main only when a fresh Opus + fresh Sol pair approves the same revision and local checks are green (CI only if the project actually runs one); the commander checks host load and session liveness before every spawn and on every completion notification and stops delegates it no longer needs. Customize the templates in `~/.ccteam/config.yaml`; changes are picked up without restarting the daemon:

```yaml
im:
  quick_templates:
    - label: "🎯 Commander"
      prefix: "Plan the task and delegate it. Task:"
    - label: "🛠 Focus"
      prefix: "Implement and verify the task directly. Task:"
```

Send these commands in chat. The gateway handles them directly. Use `/help` anytime; Telegram also shows command candidates when you type `/`.

```text
# Projects
/cd <project>              Switch to a project. First message starts a roleless session.
/projects                  List known projects.
/newproject <slug> <path>  Create and register a project, then switch to it.

# Sessions
/new [vendor] [role] [hitl] [model=<id>] [effort=<level>]
                             Create a session and return handle s<N>.
                             vendor = claude (default) | codex | grok | opencode | kimi | dsh | pi
                             omit role = bare Claude reading CLAUDE.md; provide role to bind it
                             grok/opencode/kimi/dsh = roleless ACP session (role arg ignored)
                             dsh = local-only session; cold resume and token usage are tracked
                             pi = local-only session; roles supported
                             add hitl = approve tools in IM; default skip runs directly
                             model= / effort= (or m= / e=) go to the vendor verbatim, in any
                             order; omit them to ride the vendor's own default. Ladders differ
                             per vendor — `/status` lists what each one declared.
/use <id>                  Switch to session s<N>; stopped sessions cold-resume from disk.
/role <role>               Change the current session role in place; handle stays the same.
/interrupt [id]            Interrupt an in-flight turn; keep the session. Omit id for current.
/stop <id>|all|project     Stop one session by id. Telegram shows a confirmation button; other channels stop immediately. Only sessions visible to this chat are affected.

# Inspect / onboard
/sessions [all]            List sessions for current project; all = across projects.
/status                    Team health: idle / working / stuck plus model, effort and context
                           usage, the session's own background work (subagents and background
                           shells stay listed for as long as the vendor reports them running,
                           not just during the turn that launched them), and its delegates.
                           Context occupancy is only shown when it was actually
                           measured — a session whose vendor has not reported yet reads as
                           unknown rather than 0%, and survives daemon restarts.
                           A session you have just sent a message to reads as working, not
                           stuck: silence is measured within the current turn.
/keys [off]                Show the persistent quick-template keyboard; `off` removes it.
/help                      List gateway commands.

# Delayed send (one-shot user turns)
/inbox                     List scheduled messages you can see (own + web pool), by send time.
/inbox <time> <text>       Schedule text into the **current** session (/use first if needed).
/inbox cancel <dN>         Cancel (or dismiss a failed) item by short id from the list.
```

Time forms for `/inbox <time> …` (daemon local timezone; past times are rejected, bare `HH:MM` does **not** roll to tomorrow):

```text
/inbox +30m remind me to open the PR
/inbox +2h run the nightly checklist
/inbox 22:30 write the daily summary
/inbox 明天 09:00 morning standup notes
/inbox 2026-07-26 09:00 release checklist
```

List lines look like `d3 · s12 · 2026-07-26 09:00 · preview…` (failed rows carry a reason). Successful fires are silent in IM — the text just appears as a normal user message in that session. Failures notify you and stay listed for 24 hours. Same limits as the web queue (20 per session, 7-day horizon). Empty text is rejected; a body that starts with `/` is still sent as ordinary agent text at fire time (not re-parsed as a gateway command).

### Addressing

```text
@<role>          Switch to that role's session and make it current. Alone = switch only.
@<role> <text>   Switch to it and send a message.
```

`@` always addresses a session. Deterministic control is the slash surface above (`/status`, `/sessions`, `/stop`, …); free-form ops questions ("which project burned the most today?") are ordinary chat to a session — any session answers them with the ccteam MCP tools.

### Direct Chat and File Exchange

- **Messages without a prefix** go to the current session.
- **Non-gateway slash commands** (`/compact`, `/clear`, `/model`, etc.) pass through to the current agent. Picker commands such as `/model` become option buttons.
- **Images or files plus a note** are read by the agent automatically (screenshots and logs work well). Agents can send files back to chat.
- **During an in-flight turn,** ccteam keeps a live progress message such as `working... · bash x3`. The final answer arrives separately and long answers are chunked. If the agent asks a question, it appears as option buttons; tap one and the agent continues.

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)

Sessions default to direct execution (`skip`). Start an approval-gated session with `/new <vendor> <role> hitl`. Before non-allowlisted tools run, ccteam sends the requested action plus approve / deny buttons. Approve runs the tool; deny blocks only that tool call and does not kill the turn. Claude, DSH, and Pi sessions support this — DSH and Pi route their own permission dialogs through the same approve / deny buttons, and their auto-allowed tools never prompt. Codex sessions have their own sandbox and ignore this mode. Grok and Kimi sessions currently run in `skip` (auto-approve) only; IM approval for them is planned but not yet wired.

### Let Any Session Dispatch Work

Every session can spawn colleagues, dispatch tasks, and collect results through the `mcp__ccteam__session_*` tools — no manual switching, no special role. Just ask in natural language:

```text
start a codex session, implement the RFC under docs/rfc-12.md, and report back when tests pass
```

There is no skill to install — the ccteam MCP server ships its own instructions, so any connected session already knows the whole loop (spawn, supervise, report back). For a standing orchestrator persona, install `team-brain` from the marketplace. The plain-language guide — what to say, best practices, plus a tool appendix for persona/skill authors — is [orchestration.md](orchestration.md).

### Model Routing

A session deciding whom to spawn never has to guess. One `status` call (the MCP tool, also exposed through the byte-identical discovery alias `grok_claude_codex_kimi`) answers with a **vendor panel** for the host your current project is bound to: which vendors are installed and their versions, an honest auth signal (`ready` / `not_ready` / `unknown` — sitting on PATH never masquerades as logged in), budget state, and whether the snapshot is fresh or stale. Alongside it comes an **advisory model catalog** — runtime last-seen data and the hub `models.json`, each labeled with its source and never consulted as a spawn allowlist — plus your **routing notes**, transported verbatim.

Your division of labor is plain markdown you own; ccteam carries it to any session that asks, on any host, and never parses, merges, or executes it:

- `~/.ccteam/routing.md` — the global fallback. The shared home initializer creates a neutral starter when it is missing and never overwrites your content.
- `<project>/.ccteam/routing.md` — an optional project override. When present it replaces the global file completely; the two are not merged.

Write it as a dumb table of task type → vendor/model/effort → reason. Default posture: **omit `model` at spawn** and ride the vendor default (free upgrades as vendors ship new models); the routing table only lists exceptions and upgrades. The full recipe — capability check, fan-out compare, synthesis, cost — is the [Model routing chapter](orchestration.md) of the orchestration guide.

## 3. CLI (Advanced)

Use Web / IM for daily work. The CLI is for scripts, ops, and headless environments. Commands are split into flat lifecycle commands (`init / config / start / stop / status / doctor`) and grouped commands (`project / session / role`).

### Install-Time and Service Commands

```bash
ccteam init                    # Initialize the current directory as a project (slug = dir name).
ccteam init --in /path/to/repo # Initialize elsewhere.
ccteam init --slug demo        # Override inferred slug.
ccteam init --owner user:u123  # Multi-user: assign project ownership.
ccteam config                  # One-time setup: MCP, IM bot, preferences.
ccteam config mcp              # Register/refresh ccteam MCP for config-writable vendors; useful without TTY.
ccteam daemon start            # Start the daemon in the background (setsid; idempotent).
ccteam daemon stop [--force]   # Graceful stop; --force escalates to SIGKILL (daemon only).
ccteam daemon restart          # Graceful stop + re-detach under one lock.
ccteam daemon status [--json]  # pid · ready · running-vs-binary version.
ccteam daemon logs [-f] [-n N] # Tail/follow ~/.ccteam/daemon.log.
ccteam start                   # Run in the FOREGROUND (dev / containers / your own supervisor).
ccteam start --web-bind 127.0.0.1:7331   # Local-only bind, no token.
ccteam start --dsh-web-bind off          # Disable the DSH Web companion listener.
ccteam start --no-web | --no-imd         # Gateway only / web only.
ccteam stop                    # Alias for `ccteam daemon stop`.
ccteam update [--now] [--no-restart] [--json]   # Update in place, then restart onto the new binary.
ccteam status                  # Daemon heartbeat, projects, sessions, web link, version/update hint.
ccteam doctor                  # Install/dependency checks; --verify-mcp checks MCP surface.
```

`ccteam init` only writes ccteam-owned files: project `.ccteam/` and the ccteam hook section in `.claude/settings.local.json` (it seeds no roles — `.claude/agents/` stays yours). It does **not** touch your `.claude/settings.json`. Re-running is safe. Preferences live in `~/.ccteam/preferences.toml`; currently `fallback.on_claude_quota = off|codex` controls whether Claude quota exhaustion falls back to Codex.

### `project` (Project Lifecycle)

```bash
ccteam project ls                  # List known projects.
ccteam project show demo           # Full project status and recent events.
ccteam project new demo            # Create under <projects_root>/demo/ and init (collision appends demo2, demo3, …).
ccteam project stop demo           # Stop all project sessions; resumable by id.
ccteam project rm demo             # Retire via the daemon (tombstone → stop+join sessions → clear state → drop config row).
ccteam project rm demo --dry-run   # Preview only; never contacts the daemon for a retire, never exits 2.
ccteam project rm demo --purge     # Also remove ccteam-owned traces under the project (.ccteam/, hook section).
# Exit codes: 0 done · 1 refused/nothing committed · 2 retirement committed but cleanup unfinished (re-run to finish).
# A retired slug is permanently reserved: `ccteam init --slug demo` refuses, `ccteam init` in the same directory picks `demo2`.
```

`rm --purge` removes only ccteam-owned traces: project `.ccteam/` and ccteam hook entries in `settings.local.json`. It **always keeps** your work roles, `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md`, `.env`, product code, and `.claude/settings.json`.

### `session` (Sessions)

```bash
ccteam session ls                # List gateway sessions; marks orphans.
ccteam session attach demo [sid] # Attach to a terminal-protocol session's pane.
```

> `attach` only applies to `terminal`-protocol sessions (they have a tmux pane). Default `stream-json` sessions have no pane — drive them from the web chat console or IM. Change a live session's role from IM with `/role <role>`.

### `role` (Install Roles from the Marketplace)

```bash
ccteam role search backend         # Search marketplace; official plugins first; --format json available.
ccteam role add backend-architect  # Fetch role .md, verify sha256, write to .claude/agents/.
ccteam role add data-scientist --project demo   # Install into a named project.
ccteam role list                   # List roles installed in current project.
```

ccteam reads ccteam-hub over HTTPS with a local cache at `~/.ccteam/cache/hub/`, fetches upstream files pinned to fixed commits, verifies sha256, and writes only when missing unless `--force` is used. Skills install into the user-level global library — multi-file skills land whole under `~/.ccteam/skills/<id>/` after the entire batch verifies. The web marketplace uses the same catalog.

Skills have their own command group (`ccteam role add` refuses skill ids and points here):

```bash
ccteam skill search research        # Search marketplace skills.
ccteam skill add deep-research      # Install into the global library ~/.ccteam/skills.
ccteam skill ls                     # List the library; ids may nest (baoyu-skills/baoyu-comic).
ccteam skill rm <id>                # Remove one skill; --force removes a whole tree.
ccteam skill update --all           # Re-sync hub-pinned skills that drifted.
ccteam skill source add <git-url>   # Register a multi-skill repo into the library.
ccteam skill source update --all    # Sync registered sources (ls / rm work too).
ccteam skill ensure-project         # Project-own skills: .agents/skills + .claude/skills symlink.
ccteam skill migrate-project        # Move legacy .claude/skills entities into .agents/skills.
```

The global library and project skills never mix: nothing links or copies from the library into a project — sessions reference library skills per message (composer attach), while project-own skills live in the project as normal git-visible files.

### Operations

```bash
ccteam status                      # Daemon + projects/sessions + web token/url lines.
ccteam session ls                  # Gateway session status; degrades when daemon is offline.
ccteam doctor --verify-mcp         # MCP surface check: 8 tools / 0 stubs; drift exits 1.
```

Restart daemon only; sessions reconnect by id afterward (a session still mid-turn is waited for, never duplicated):

```bash
ccteam daemon restart              # or: make daemon-restart (rebuilds release first)
```

### Updating

```bash
ccteam update                      # Update in place, then restart the daemon onto the new binary.
ccteam update --no-restart         # Swap the binary only; apply later with `ccteam daemon restart`.
ccteam update --now                # Skip the drain wait and restart immediately.
```

`ccteam update` detects how ccteam was installed and re-runs that install path — for the one-click / prebuilt install it replays `install.sh` (same download + SHA-256 verify + atomic swap; no second downloader). A from-source checkout is never recompiled for you: it prints `git pull && make install`. After the binary is swapped, if a managed daemon is running, `update` waits for in-flight turns to go idle (up to 5 minutes; `--now` skips the wait), gracefully restarts the daemon onto the new binary, and verifies the running version matches.

What a daemon restart does to live sessions is the resume-by-id contract plus one rule — **one session, one process**: `terminal`/tmux sessions keep running (separate process tree); a default `stream-json` session's process is let go, not killed — an idle one exits on its own, a session mid-turn keeps working to the end of its turn. The new daemon finds such a survivor by its body record (`<project>/.ccteam/chat/<sid>/body.json`) and never starts a second process for the same session: the session shows as `detached` (web rail, `session_list activity:detached`, IM `/sessions`), messages sent to it queue and are delivered the moment that process exits, `/stop` / `session_stop` ends it now, and when it exits ccteam recovers the answer it gave in the meantime from Claude's own transcript and delivers it (IM/web reply, delegation notification) before rebuilding the session by id. ACP (grok/kimi/opencode) and codex processes end with the daemon; their in-flight turn is interrupted and the session resumes its context by id on the next message. `ccteam status` and `ccteam doctor` show the install channel, the running-vs-binary version, and whether a newer release is available (a lazy check, at most once every ~20h; toggle with `check_for_update` in `preferences.toml`). **Satellites update themselves** — run `ccteam update` on each; the console's Hosts view and `ccteam status` flag any host whose version lags the daemon.

State file quick reference. `~/.ccteam` is grouped by responsibility: `secrets/` for credentials, `state/` for daemon-written state, `cache/` for disposable cache, and `run/` for sockets.

```bash
journalctl --user -u ccteam -n 120               # Daemon log (systemd journal; or make daemon-logs).
cat ~/.ccteam/config.yaml                        # Project registry: slug -> path.
cat ~/.ccteam/state/gateway/routing.json         # Chat routing: current project/session + live set.
cat ~/.ccteam/state/sessions/next-sid            # Monotonic sid counter; never reused.
cat <project>/.ccteam/chat/<sid>/meta.json       # Session SoT: vendor/role/owner/uuid...
tail ~/.ccteam/state/im/outbound.jsonl           # Outbound ledger; replayed after restart.
cat <project>/.ccteam/progress.jsonl             # Project business events; state authority.
```

Environment variables:

```bash
CCTEAM_HOME=~/.ccteam2          # Isolate a full state/config/session tree; pairs with ccteam --home.
CCTEAM_PROJECTS_ROOT=...        # Default project root; default ~/projects.
CCTEAM_CLAUDE_BIN=... CCTEAM_CODEX_BIN=... CCTEAM_GROK_BIN=... CCTEAM_OPENCODE_BIN=... CCTEAM_DSH_BIN=...
# Override vendor CLI paths (tests / non-PATH installs).
```

### Multi-Machine (Satellites)

Every node runs the same `ccteam start`. A node becomes a **satellite** of another daemon by joining it once — after that it **dials out** to the daemon (reverse connection): only the daemon needs a reachable address/port (`:7331`); satellites expose nothing and work from behind NAT/firewalls. Put an HTTPS reverse proxy in front of the daemon and all satellite traffic is `wss`.

```bash
# On the daemon (or web console → 主机 page): mint a join token.
ccteam host mint-token --daemon http://daemon-host:7331 --web-token <admin-hex>

# On the satellite (any machine running ccteam start):
ccteam host join --daemon http://daemon-host:7331 --token <join-token>
# The running `ccteam start` picks the join up within 30s and connects out.

ccteam host ls                     # This machine's satellite credentials (if joined).

# Deregister a satellite (Team → Charter roster shows every host with a remove
# button too). Refuses a live host unless --force; `local` can never be removed.
ccteam host rm <host-id> --daemon http://daemon-host:7331 --web-token <admin-hex> [--force]
```

The satellite reports its agents and registered projects every ~25s over its control channel; the hosts page shows online/offline live. **Projects are bound to a host** — to run sessions on a satellite, give it a project there and spawn into that project (no per-session host choice):

- **Create remotely:** web console → new project → pick the satellite in the host picker → absolute path on that machine. The daemon asks the satellite to bootstrap and register it in place.
- **Import an existing checkout:** `ccteam init` in the repo on that machine, then hosts page → 接入/Import next to the reported project. Same-slug collisions get a distinct catalog slug (`demo` → `demo2`) — slug equality across machines is not project identity.

Remote execution currently supports Claude stream-json sessions; the connection self-heals with backoff, and a dropped exec link resumes context via vendor `--resume` on the next spawn. Pi and DSH are local-only by design — their sessions run on the daemon's own machine, and a project bound to a satellite refuses those spawns with a plain error rather than quietly running them somewhere else. Fleet capacity: at most 50 live sessions daemon-wide (configurable `sessions.max_live`); admitting one more gracefully stops the least-recently-active idle session, which stays resumable.

---

## Troubleshooting

Start with these three commands; they usually locate the issue:

```bash
ccteam doctor
ccteam status
journalctl --user -u ccteam -n 120
```

1. **`ccteam: command not found`** - `~/.local/bin` is not in PATH. Run `export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"`.
2. **Telegram does not reply / log says `drop msg from non-allowed chat`** - chat id is not allowlisted, or credentials changed without restart. Fix `allowed_chat_ids` in `~/.ccteam/secrets/im-credentials.json` or Web Settings, then restart daemon.
3. **IM says send failed / session has no output yet** - restart daemon and send the same `@handle` again. For long contexts, first try `@bot /compact`; if it keeps failing, start a fresh session with `/new`.
4. **`/cd` or `/new` says project not found** - initialize or reload the project: `cd <repo> && ccteam init`, restart daemon, check `/projects`, then `/cd <slug>`.
5. **Web does not open / asks for token** - use the full `web url` printed at the end of `ccteam status`. Or bind locally with `--web-bind 127.0.0.1:7331` to skip token.

> Claude sessions from IM default to `skip` (direct execution, no approval gate). Expose the bot only to trusted chats, and never commit bot tokens. For per-tool approval, start with `/new <vendor> <role> hitl`.
