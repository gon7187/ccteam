Each coding CLI is brilliant alone but works in isolation — one terminal, one context, no colleagues:

- **Claude Code** — plans the deepest
- **Codex** — grinds long jobs without wobbling
- **Grok** — answers fastest
- **Kimi** — bulk work on a tiny bill
- **DSH** — hires live inside your own DeepSeek Harness web space, side by side with you
- **Pi** — one CLI over many providers (`anthropic/…`, `openai/…`), on your own machine

ccteam is the connective tissue they lack — identity, routing, delivery guarantees, guardrails, a cost ledger — and leaves *how* the team organizes itself to prompts you version.

  <br/>
  <sub><b>An afternoon on the Team page</b> — 50 live sessions across four vendors, every delegation a traceable parent→child edge, every dollar on the ledger.</sub>
</p>

## Usage

**1 · Remote control from Telegram / Lark**

Paste a bot token once (Settings → Access) and the chat becomes a full console — completion notifications, HITL `[approve] [deny]` buttons, and shipped files all land in the same thread. Live progress is one ordinary message edited in place, so the composer stays usable; `/status`, `/sessions`, and follow-up turns remain responsive while an agent is working. Dispatch at midnight, close the laptop, find the result at breakfast:

```text
/cd demo                        # pick a project; your next message talks to it
/new codex effort=high          # more sessions: /new [vendor] [role] [model=…] [effort=…]
@s2 run the test suite          # address any session directly
/status  /sessions  /stop s3    # health · fleet · cost · stop
/inbox +30m remind me …         # schedule a one-shot user turn; /inbox lists · cancel dN
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/telegram-console.png" width="640" alt="Telegram as a full console — /projects to switch project, /use to pick a session, /status showing the session's model, context, usage and its working/idle children" />
  <br/>
  <sub><b>Telegram is the whole console</b> — switch projects, address any session, and one <code>/status</code> card shows the brain plus every delegate it hired.</sub>
</p>

**2 · Remote control from the web console**

The installer runs the daemon; `ccteam status` reprints your link (`http://<lan-ip>:7331/?token=…`) — open it from any device on your LAN. It's a chat shell, not a dashboard:

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/web-launcher.png" width="1000" alt="The web launcher — pick a project, host, role, vendor and model in one pill, type, and the session is born on your first message; six formation playbooks below prefill a vendor lineup" />
  <br/>
  <sub><b>No “create session” form</b> — pick project · host · vendor · model in one pill and just type; the formation playbooks below prefill a whole lineup.</sub>
</p>

- six formation playbooks (commander & crews, driver & advisor, cross review, bake-off, research triangulation, cost pyramid) that prefill the launcher with a vendor lineup. Commander starts with Claude Fable at `high` effort and sizes every top-level task first: small (≤3 files, no money/secrets/scope risk) runs one lane → GLM pre-gate → one Codex Sol gate with no Claude involved; medium gets a one-page Fable plan, one Sol review round, lane implementers and a single fresh Sol gate; large runs the full pipeline — a read-only OpenCode GLM (`zai-coding-plan/glm-5.3-flash`) scout, a Fable plan under `.ccteam/plans/`, a Sol plan gate that stays on as advisor, three vendor lanes (Codex Luna backend/money/ETL, Claude Sonnet frontend/routes/glue, GLM tests/docs/boilerplate) in per-task git worktrees, a GLM pre-gate (lint, targeted tests, secret scan, plan checklist), a GLM git agent, and a Fable + Sol dual gate on the integrated diff. Effort is per size and per round (second round +1 rung, boilerplate stays low, hard tasks never below `high`); flexible tasks go to the vendor with the smallest `tokens_24h` share reported by MCP `status` (15 % relative skew threshold, subscription windows above 80 % override); four typed fallback triggers (capability error, two `server_overloaded` in a row, 30 minutes of silence, a report without `Status: done`) switch a role to its fallback vendor exactly once per task. `status` now shows per-vendor 24h spend, tokens and subscription quota windows.
- a Chat tab per session (plus a byte-faithful terminal where applicable), including a clock on the composer to queue delayed user turns above the input
- a Team page: the live delegation topology — vendor, the model and reasoning effort each session is actually running, cost, every row a real link so a parent and its delegate open side by side — plus a division-of-labor charter (the per-project `routing.md` agents read via `status`) edited in place
- a DSH page that opens DeepSeek Harness Web inside ccteam: the daemon authenticates the request, starts or attaches the right local DSH web instance, and gives each logged-in user a separate DSH home
- a cost pill with daily budget caps
- a per-project ⋯ menu in the sidebar: start a session there, copy its path, or take the project out of ccteam (deregister + stop its live sessions — your directory and code are never touched)
- marketplace and settings

Everything the console does is also `/api/v1` (OpenAPI at `/api/docs`).

**3 · Orchestrate a team from inside a claude session**

Any registered session can hire the others — say it in plain language and `session_spawn` / `dispatch` / `collect` run under the hood (with an honest `working` / `idle` signal, so nobody guesses from silence):

```text
Spawn a codex session, have it implement RFC-12 and run the tests; report back when green.

Plan this refactor, then delegate: codex implements, grok profiles the hot path in
parallel, kimi sweeps the rename across the repo. Collect everything into one summary.

Spawn a claude reviewer on s2's diff — I'm not merging until it signs off.
```

**4 · Many machines, one console**

Register a satellite with a join token (Settings → Access) — it dials out to your daemon, so a laptop behind NAT works fine. Projects are bound to a host and run where they live: spawn into the GPU-box project and its tests run on the GPU box, while transcripts, cost, and the team view stay in one console. Switching machines is just switching projects.

> Satellite execution currently runs Claude sessions; the other vendors run on the daemon's machine.

---

Under all four modes are the same **eight MCP tools**, available to every session, to your plain hand-started CLIs once registered, and to **any external agent** that presents an enrollment credential over `POST /mcp` — one credential per vendor config or per copy-button, and the daemon issues each *process* its own identity when it connects, so two agents sharing a config are still two callers with their own ledger rows and their own children:

```text
session_spawn · session_dispatch · session_collect · session_list · session_stop
status (+ its discovery alias grok_claude_codex_kimi) · chat_send_file
```

The daemon routes and records — at-least-once notifications across restarts, idempotency keys, a child's turn written to disk before its parent is told, guardrails that refuse runaway fan-out with a reason. When a web-driven session finishes autonomous work while nobody is watching the console, the final answer is mirrored to your IM; the IM `/status` card shows your session's working children at a glance. It never schedules; *when* to delegate lives in prompts you version.

## Install

Runs on **macOS**, **Linux**, and **Windows (via WSL)**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Bring your own coding CLI — install and authenticate at least one before you start.** ccteam is the bridge, not the agent: it spawns the vendor CLIs already on the machine a project is bound to, so a vendor that is missing (or installed but not authenticated) cannot host a session.
>
> - **Claude Code** — install [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code), then `claude auth login`
> - **Codex** — install [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), then `codex login`
> - **Grok Build** — install [Grok CLI](https://docs.x.ai/build/overview), then `grok login`
> - **OpenCode** — install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then `opencode auth login`
> - **Kimi Code** — install [Kimi Code](https://moonshotai.github.io/kimi-code/), then `kimi login`
> - **DSH** — install [DeepSeek Harness](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh) with `npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`. DSH sessions and DSH Web use `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` when set, otherwise the identity's DSH Settings → Models config.
> - **Pi** — install [Pi](https://pi.dev/), then set your provider key and check it with `pi auth check --provider <provider>`
>
> Any one of them is enough to start. Afterwards `ccteam status` and **Settings → Hosts** report, per machine, which vendors are installed, their versions, and whether each is actually authenticated — sitting on `PATH` never counts as logged in.

**1 · One-click script**

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firstintent/ccteam/main/install.sh | sh
```

One static binary into `~/.local/bin`, no sudo. Every install mode — the script, `make install`, and `ccteam update` — resolves the destination through the same ladder (`CCTEAM_INSTALL_DIR` → wherever `ccteam` already lives → `~/.local/bin`), so an upgrade replaces the copy you are actually running instead of leaving a second one to shadow it.

**2 · Let an agent do it** — paste into any agent you already have:

> Install https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam — follow `INSTALL.md` in the repo.

**3 · From source** (Rust + Node):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam && cd ccteam && make install
```

**Start it** — `ccteam daemon start` runs ccteam in the background and keeps it running after you close the terminal (`make install` already did this for you). Manage it any time:

```bash
ccteam daemon start          # start in the background; prints your web console link
ccteam daemon status         # is it running, and on which version?
ccteam daemon restart        # restart it
ccteam daemon stop           # stop it (your sessions come back next time you start)
ccteam daemon logs -f        # watch the logs live
```

After you reboot your computer, run `ccteam daemon start` again to bring ccteam back.

**Configure in the browser** — open the printed link (also shown by `ccteam status`), create a project, and just type; the session is born on your first message. Then:

- **Settings → Access** — everything that connects to ccteam, on one page: the copy-paste MCP config for external agents (a credential scoped to one project, rendered as the real config each vendor expects, or as plain text for plugin-backed flows such as DSH, listed and revocable afterwards — the secret is shown once, never again), satellite join tokens for new machines, your own Telegram/Lark bot (a numbered two-step card per platform — save the credential, then bind who the bot answers, with sender capture starting on its own), and per-user login links
- **Settings → Hosts** — each machine's vendor panel (installed / version / readiness) and one-click registration of the ccteam MCP tools into the vendor CLIs with writable config (Claude Code, Codex, Grok, OpenCode, Kimi), so even hand-started sessions can hire the team. DSH's one-click on the same page registers ccteam's plugin into your own `~/.dsh` web profile instead (a DSH session of yours can also orchestrate after pasting an Access credential); Pi gets the team tools through a ccteam-owned bridge loaded into the sessions ccteam spawns, so a `pi` you start by hand in a shell is left completely untouched
- **Workflow → Marketplace** — install skills (into your user-level library `~/.ccteam/skills`; the skills tab comes first) and personas (into the project), checksum-verified; attach library skills to any message from the composer
- **Workflow → Evolution** — accept or revise a completed answer, attach concrete feedback, and open a dedicated HITL session for an improvement proposal. ccteam auto-approves nothing in that session; write/apply requests wait for explicit human approval. The canonical verdict journal survives rebuilds and rotation; the dashboard keeps accepted/revised/unrated, outcome, duration, pricing coverage, and spawn-time role/skill attribution explicit, with missing facts shown as unknown rather than zero. The analytics API additionally reports steered turns, stratifies failure/steer counts per vendor inside every fingerprint bucket, and — where the event stream deterministically observed a skill being invoked — the strict invoked subset next to spawn-time availability, so user-space evolution loops get an auditable, vendor-honest canary surface
- **DSH** — open native DSH Web as a first-class console page. Each identity runs one DSH runtime and ccteam is its second client: DSH sessions hired anywhere in ccteam are created inside that same runtime, appear live in this page's sidebar under the project's workspace, and can be opened mid-task to watch or interject — the agent's next dispatch continues the same conversation. The owner sees the real `~/.dsh` space (ccteam attaches to a DSH Web already on `127.0.0.1:3080` when present); each regular user gets an isolated `$CCTEAM_HOME/runtime/dsh/web/<user>/` space with the ccteam client plugin preloaded. It works out of the box by following this machine's DSH login until the user changes DSH Settings → Models; the whole identity — menu sessions and hires alike — runs on that one config. User-installed DSH plugins are preserved.

</p>

> The console binds to `0.0.0.0:7331` with token auth, no TLS — keep it on a trusted LAN. DSH Web uses a companion listener on the web port + 1 by default; override it with `--dsh-web-bind <addr:port>` or disable it with `--dsh-web-bind off`. If you put HTTPS in front of ccteam, proxy the companion listener too (usually a second HTTPS port or subdomain). Proxying only `:7331` makes the DSH iframe mixed-content fail, and DSH Web cannot be safely mounted under a path prefix.

> DSH Web honesty: native DSH turns run inside DSH, not as ccteam sessions, so they do not appear in the ccteam cost ledger — including turns you type into a hired session from the DSH side (ccteam records only the turns it routed; the DSH home keeps the full conversation). Work delegated through the ccteam DSH plugin is ledgered normally. Tenant DSH Web is same-OS-user isolation: DSH agents can run shell commands, and self-installed DSH plugins are arbitrary npm code with the same trust level as that user account.

## Chaining sessions

Delegation is explicit — an agent (or you) says who does what, and the bridge handles identity, routing, delivery, and the ledger:

```text
session_spawn{vendor:"codex", title:"impl",  task:"implement RFC-12, run tests, report"}
session_spawn{vendor:"grok",  title:"probe", task:"profile the hot path", wait_seconds:120}
session_spawn{vendor:"kimi",  title:"chore", task:"apply the rename across every module"}
```

Async by default: the completion notification lands in the parent's chat like a colleague reporting back. `wait_seconds` is for sub-minute answers you need inline.

**Common workflows:**

- **Plan → build → gate** — claude decomposes and sets constraints; codex implements; a rival model reviews the diff before you merge.
- **Grind + probe** — codex holds the long job while grok answers the quick question before codex finishes a step.
- **Bulk on a budget** — fan the repetitive 80% out to kimi; keep the judgment calls on claude.

Who gets what starts from facts, not guesses: one `status` call is the roster — vendors installed, authenticated, and in-budget on the project's host, each one's models and reasoning-effort levels as it last declared them, and your routing notes (`<project>/.ccteam/routing.md` over the global fallback).

Every spawn surface takes `model` and `effort` for every vendor and forwards both verbatim — the vendor owns the verdict on its own values, so a level it refuses comes back as a real error instead of a session quietly running at the default. Omit them and the vendor's own defaults hold. The ladders differ (claude `low…max`, codex `low…xhigh`, grok `low|medium|high`, kimi `low|high|max`, and pi's is per *model* — it declares which levels the chosen model actually supports), so ask rather than guess: `status` for agents, `GET /api/v1/models` for programs, and the web composer's menus render from the same source.

## Project context

ccteam adds a team to your repo without taking it over:

- **Roleless by default** — the brain reads *your* `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` through the vendor's own mechanism; ccteam never rewrites project knowledge.
- **Small footprint** — exactly `.ccteam/` (state), `.claude/agents/` (personas you install), and ccteam's own section of `.claude/settings.local.json` — never your `settings.json`.
- **Durable sessions** — ids (`s1`, `s2`, …) survive daemon restarts and cold-resume from disk; state is plain files in your repo. One session, one process: a restart never kills an agent mid-turn and never starts a second one beside it — the daemon lets the process finish, queues what you send it meanwhile, recovers the answer it gave from the vendor's own record, and resumes the session by id.

## Extras

- **Marketplace** — personas install from [ccteam-hub](https://github.com/firstintent/ccteam-hub) into your project's `.claude/agents/`; skills install into the user-level global library `~/.ccteam/skills` (nested ids, whole-repo sources via `ccteam skill source add`), then attach to sessions per message — the library never links or copies into a project, while project-own skills live in `.agents/skills/` as normal git-visible files (`ccteam skill ensure-project`). Everything is fetched from pinned upstreams, sha256-verified, copied verbatim, never executed. Vendor-native Claude Code plugins are delegated to Claude Code itself (ccteam only flips the two settings keys).
- **HITL approvals** — spawn a session in approval mode and its permission requests reach your IM as `[approve] [deny]` buttons, through the vendor's native gate; deny blocks the tool call without killing the turn.

## Why

Seven excellent coding CLIs shipped in two years, and each assumes it's alone. The result: you, alt-tabbing between vendors, re-pasting context, playing message bus. The fix isn't a framework on top — the vendors' harnesses are already great. It's the connective tissue they lack: identity, routing, delivery, cost, observability, across vendors and machines. That's ccteam — `cc` for the Claude Code it grew out of, `team` for what your agents become.

It stays deliberately underneath:

- **No prompt injection** — personas load through the vendor's native mechanism; task text is forwarded verbatim.
- **No terminal scraping** — state comes from transcripts and structured events.
- **Measurements, never placeholders** — a context reading you see was really reported by that vendor and survives restarts; one it has not reported yet reads as unknown, not `0%`.
- **Local first** — `~/.ccteam` and your repos; no cloud in the loop.
- **Budgets guard, never kill** — daily per-vendor caps are the only automatic brake.

## Update

```bash
ccteam update                # update in place; restarts the daemon onto the new binary
```

`ccteam status` shows your version and flags a newer release. (Details: [usage](docs/usage.md#updating).)

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/firstintent/ccteam/main/install.sh | sh -s -- --uninstall
rm -rf ~/.ccteam        # state, secrets, hub cache — keep it if you may return
```

Per project, delete `.ccteam/` and ccteam's section of `.claude/settings.local.json`.
