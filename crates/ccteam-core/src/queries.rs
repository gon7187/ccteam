//! V0.3 M5.1 — read-side query helpers shared by every channel layer.
//!
//! Promoted from `ccteam-cli/src/commands.rs` (where they lived as
//! `pub fn`s but were not callable from sibling crates because
//! depending on the binary `ccteam-cli` is a dep-graph anti-pattern).
//! Mirrors `actions.rs` (the M5.0 write-helper promotion):
//!
//! - the V0.3 web UI crate (`ccteam-web`) reads project state /
//!   progress events through this module without depending on
//!   `ccteam-cli`.
//! - the MCP server in `ccteam-cli::mcp_serve` consumes these helpers
//!   identically (the function bodies are unchanged from their
//!   `commands.rs` originals; only their home moves).
//! - `commands.rs::run_ls` / `run_progress` re-export the names from
//!   here so existing callers keep their current `use` lines minus the
//!   module path change.
//!
//! These helpers are **read-only**:
//!
//! - they do **not** mutate `state.json` or write progress events.
//! - they do **not** parse tmux output (architecture red line,
//!   CLAUDE.md §三 — `progress.jsonl` is the orchestrator's SoT).
//! - corrupt / unparseable files surface as logged warnings + skipped
//!   entries; never panics or crashes the caller.
//!
//! Architecture refs: `docs/versions/v0-3/prd.md` §4 (M5.1 dashboard data
//! source), `docs/dev-coupling-audit.md` F45 (extends the M5.0
//! write-helper promotion to the read side), `docs/dev/tech-design.md`
//! §5.5 progress.jsonl SoT.
