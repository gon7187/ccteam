/// axis ccteam registers, so a session understands the multi-vendor surface,
/// and leaves the division of labor entirely to the user). Installed state,
/// versions, and per-vendor model/effort catalogs are deliberately NOT
/// snapshotted here: the vendor panel in the same `status` response is their
/// live home, and a written-once copy would go stale. A unit test pins this
/// list to `host_registry::AGENT_PROBE_SPECS` so a new vendor cannot be
/// added without updating the starter.
const DEFAULT_ROUTING_NOTES: &str = "# ccteam routing notes\n\n\
Your division of labor, in your own words. Sessions that call `status` receive\n\
this file verbatim; ccteam never parses, merges, or acts on it.\n\n\
## Harnesses ccteam can drive\n\n\
ccteam registers these agent harnesses (spawn any of them via `session_spawn`\n\
or the web/IM entry points):\n\n\
- `claude` — Claude Code (Anthropic)\n\
- `codex` — Codex CLI (OpenAI)\n\
- `grok` — Grok CLI (xAI)\n\
- `opencode` — OpenCode\n\
- `kimi` — Kimi Code (Moonshot)\n\
- `pi` — Pi (local-only harness)\n\
- `dsh` — DSH / DeepSeek Harness (local-only harness)\n\n\
Which of them are actually installed on this machine — with versions and each\n\
vendor's advisory model + effort catalog — arrives live in the vendor panel of\n\
the same `status` response as these notes. Trust that panel, not a list here.\n\n\
## Division of labor (yours to write)\n\n\
ccteam pre-assigns no roles. Default posture: omit `model` at spawn and ride\n\
each vendor's default. When you develop preferences, write them below in your\n\
own words — e.g. one row per task type:\n\n\
| Task type | vendor / model / effort | Why |\n\
|---|---|---|\n\
| (yours) | | |\n\n\
<!--\n\
A project replaces these global notes entirely with its own\n\
<project>/.ccteam/routing.md (never merged). Never store secrets in either\n\
file: ccteam returns the selected file verbatim to sessions that call status.\n\
