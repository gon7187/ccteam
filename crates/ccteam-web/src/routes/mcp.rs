//! v0.9 T4 — Streamable HTTP MCP endpoint (`POST /mcp`).
//!
//! One JSON-RPC 2.0 message in → one JSON-RPC response out via
//! [`ccteam_im::mcp::McpDispatch`]. No SSE push (a `GET` is 405, which the
//! transport defines as "this server offers no server-initiated stream").
//!
//! **Auth — self-gated, bearer-only, and there is no admin tier.** This router
//! mounts OUTSIDE the web `auth_layer` (see `lib::router_with_state`): that
//! layer only understands the web-token family (`ccteam:<hex>` + cookies) and
//! would 401 a session bearer before this handler ran — which silently
//! downgraded every managed session's A2A call to an admin fallback and dropped
//! the delegation parent (fixed v0.9.2). [`require_mcp_auth`] is the single
//! gate, and it resolves exactly TWO families — a credential that PARSES as one
//! is answered by that family or 401'd, never retried as another:
//!
//! 1. session principal `ccteam-sid:<sid>:<secret>` → the caller IS that
//!    managed session: Ambient with the FULL caller identity injected (the
//!    delegation-parent edge)
//! 2. enrollment credential `ccteam-enroll:<id>:<secret>` → a hand-started or
//!    external client, whose per-process identity this route issues (see below)
//!
//! **Why the data plane has no admin tier.** The web token used to be a third
//! family here, and it was written into all five vendors' GLOBAL MCP configs so
//! that any hand-started agent could orchestrate. But a vendor's global config
//! is one static file shared by every process that vendor ever starts, so a
//! durable credential written into it cannot say WHICH caller is speaking.
//! Measured consequence: two `codex` runs in different repos authenticated as
//! the same machine-wide caller, so neither could be a delegation parent and
//! their `session_spawn` children mounted as ROOTS in a project nobody had
//! named. A credential a static file can carry must therefore grant nothing by
//! itself — which is why the tier is *deleted* rather than narrowed: an
//! identity-free caller has no correct amount of authority. The web token still
//! authenticates the REST/web control plane (`/api/v1/**`, cookies, the SPA),
//! where it names a browser session rather than a process.
//!
//! A bearer is ALWAYS required — even when `AuthState.enabled == false`
//! (loopback / `--no-auth`): DNS-rebinding / local-script hardening; curated
//! per-session configs and external clients always hold a token. Cookies
//! never authenticate `/mcp`.
//!
//! ## The enrollment family is the one STATEFUL path
//!
//! An enrollment credential says only *whose* the config is
//! ([`ccteam_core::enroll`]) and carries no authority of its own — that is what
//! makes it safe to leave in a static file. The per-PROCESS identity is issued
//! HERE, at `initialize`, as the transport's own `Mcp-Session-Id`:
//!
//! ```text
//! initialize + enroll bearer            -> open a binding, mint its ledger node,
//!                                          answer with Mcp-Session-Id
//! any later request + enroll bearer
//!                  + Mcp-Session-Id     -> that node's identity, injected exactly
//!                                          like a managed session's
//! DELETE, or the idle sweep             -> binding + node closed; the next call 404s
//!                                          and the client re-initializes
//! ```
//!
//! The node is a real sid with a real `meta.json` (`managed_by: external`) that
//! authenticates like any managed session — which is why nothing downstream
//! needed a new code path for it. What it never gets is a project ccteam
//! GUESSED. A binding's workspace comes from exactly one of three rungs, in
//! order:
//!
//! 1. the credential's own pinned scope ([`EnrollScope::Project`]);
//! 2. a project **named on a `session_*` call** whose owner may see it
//!    ([`bind_named_project`]) — the client says the word, ccteam checks it with
//!    the same predicate the REST choke point uses, and the binding keeps it for
//!    life;
//! 3. otherwise refuse, naming the projects this credential could reach.
//!
//! Rung 2 is what makes the machine-wide credential `ccteam config` writes into
//! every vendor's global config usable at all: that credential names no project
//! by construction (it is one file shared by every process), so without a
//! client-driven way to name one, a hand-started agent could only ever discover
//! its tool face. It is still not inference — an unnamed project stays refused,
//! and a named one the owner cannot see is answered exactly like one that does
//! not exist.
