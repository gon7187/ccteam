//! Per-session SSE replay ring (v0.8.22 P1 — review §3.1-3).
//!
//! The gateway's event broadcast only reaches whoever is subscribed AT THE
//! MOMENT an event fires; a reconnecting SSE client (network blip, laptop
//! sleep, tab backgrounded) that resubscribes a moment later has already
//! missed anything sent during the gap — including a HITL approval prompt,
//! which then silently vanishes from view while its 120s TTL keeps ticking
//! toward an auto-deny the user never saw coming.
//!
//! [`SessionEventRing`] is a small (64-entry), per-sid, monotonically
//! sequenced replay buffer AND the live fan-out tap every per-connection SSE
//! handler subscribes through (`crate::routes::sessions_api::handle_session_events`
//! no longer touches the gateway's raw broadcast directly — see
//! [`Self::subscribe`]). Recording happens at ONE choke point
//! ([`Self::record`]), called by:
//!
//! - the persistent feeder task ([`spawn_ring_feeder`], spawned once from
//!   [`crate::state::AppState::with_gateway`]) — keeps the ring populated
//!   even while nobody is connected, which is exactly the gap a reconnect
//!   needs backfilled;
//! - [`crate::routes::sessions_api`]'s pending-approval reseed, which
//!   synthesizes + records a fresh entry when an outstanding approval isn't
//!   already covered by the ring.
//!
//! Every recorded entry gets a per-sid, strictly-increasing `seq` (never
//! reused/reset even as older entries are evicted past capacity) that is
//! set as the wire-level SSE `id:` field — the client's `Last-Event-ID` on
//! reconnect. A reconnecting client's `seq` gap is replayed from the ring;
//! a client with no `seq` at all (a brand-new tab) gets no ring replay (the
//! ordinary "start fresh" SSE contract) — but still gets the UNCONDITIONAL
//! pending-approval reseed, since that reads live from
//! `PendingInteractions`, not from ring contents.
