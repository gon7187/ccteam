///   NOT shelling out to `codex exec` / `claude -p`, which bypasses the
///   ledger (no sid, no transcript, no cost, invisible to `session_list`).

pub const CCTEAM_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "ccteam is the local agent bridge: any session can hire other agent sessions \
(Claude Code / Codex / Grok / OpenCode / Kimi / Pi / DSH; Pi and DSH are local-only, the others may run on a registered satellite host) and ccteam does the identity, \
routing, delivery, guardrails, cost ledger, and team observability underneath.\n\n\
ORCHESTRATION (important): when the user asks you to call / use / delegate to another agent (e.g. \"call codex\", \
\"use grok to search\", \"spawn a reviewer\"), use the `session_*` tools — `session_spawn` starts a session (pick \
`vendor`: `claude` / `codex` / `grok` / `opencode` / `kimi` / `pi` / `dsh`, optionally \
`model` / `role`, and pass the first `task` in the same call); its execution host is inherited from the project \
binding. `session_dispatch` sends follow-up tasks \
(async with a completion notification for managed parent sessions, or `wait_seconds` to block inline), `session_collect` reads its output \
(`tail:true` for the final answer), `session_list` shows the delegation tree (`is_self` marks YOUR row), \
`session_stop` ends it. Do NOT shell \
out to vendor CLIs (`codex exec`, `claude -p`, …) for this: a raw CLI run has no session id, no transcript, no cost \
tracking, no completion notification, and is invisible to the team — it bypasses the bridge. The tools work both \
from ccteam-spawned sessions (per-session principal) and from a hand-started agent, which enrolls on its first \
call: if your first `session_*` call is refused for having no project, name one (`project: \"<slug>\"`) — the error \
lists the ones you can reach, and the first project you name is your workspace for the rest of the session. ccteam \
never guesses it from your working directory. A hand-started agent has no return transport for a completion \
notification, so async responses report `notify_deliverable:false`; poll `session_collect` (or use \
`wait_seconds`) instead.\n\n\
CHAT ROUTING: ccteam routes IM (Telegram / web) chats to you and back. \
An inbound chat message may arrive wrapped in a `<channel source=\"…\" chat_id=\"…\" user=\"…\" message_id=\"…\">` tag.\n\n\
ATTACHMENTS (important): if a `<channel …>` tag carries an `image_path=\"/abs/path\"` attribute, immediately `Read` that file — \
it is an image the user attached (often an error screenshot) and is essential context. If it carries a `file_path=\"/abs/path\"` \
attribute, `Read` that file too. Further attachments may appear in the body as `[attachment image_path=\"…\"]` / \
`[attachment file_path=\"…\"]` lines — `Read` each of those as well. Do this BEFORE you answer; the user expects you to have \
looked at the file they sent.";
