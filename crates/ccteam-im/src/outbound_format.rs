//! Pure-function helpers for shaping outbound IM payloads before the
//! Channel transport sends them.
//!
//! Today this module hosts one decision — F199's "is this bot one of
//! several sharing the same IM chat?" → prefix the reply with `from
//! <handle>:` so the human-facing IM room can tell which ccteam role
//! actually spoke. In a chat-squad workflow N bots typically share one
//! Telegram bot token (or even with N tokens, the squad's group view
//! collapses to "ccteam_bot: ..." with no per-role hint). Without this
//! prefix the user sees three messages from the same TG-side username
//! and can't tell which ccteam role said what.
//!
//! Single-bot DM stays unprefixed (one sender, no ambiguity). The
//! "should I prefix" decision keys off the bot's sibling count for
//! `(im_platform, im_chat_id)` in the active registry snapshot.

/// the registry from disk on the dispatcher hot path so the slice
/// already includes `bot`. The implementation tolerates the absent
/// case (count of siblings stays unchanged either way) so the helper
/// is robust against transient registry races.

    // sibling means the chat is multi-bot from the user's POV, so we
    // still want the prefix. `> 1` captures both cases cleanly when
    // self is in the slice (the common case); the absent-self case
    // would require `>= 1` to be defensive, but the F199 spec aligns
    // on "siblings exist" which `> 1` reflects when self is counted.
