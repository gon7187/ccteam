//! The registry behind `ccteam-sid:<sid>:<secret>` — who a managed session is
//! allowed to be, for as long as that secret is worth anything.
//!
//! **Why this is not just a field on the live session.** A session's principal
//! is minted with its sid, handed to the vendor as part of the spawn (an
//! `mcp.json`, an ACP `mcpServers[]`, a bridge env var), and USED by the vendor
//! before the spawn returns — OpenCode dials `/mcp` inside `session/new`, and
//! Pi's bridge blocks its whole `session_start` on `initialize` + `tools/list`.
//! Authority that only begins when the session lands in the gateway's live map
//! therefore arrives too late for the very handshake it was minted for:
//!
//! - OpenCode: 401 during `session/new` → its MCP client burns a 30s startup
//!   timeout → EVERY managed spawn cost half a minute.
//! - Pi: the bridge's `fetch` never returns, so `session_start` never ends, so
//!   the child never reads stdin, so the handshake times out at 30s.
//!
//! Keeping it separate buys a second, larger property: **verifying a principal
//! must not need the gateway lock.** Pi's deadlock was exactly that cycle —
//! `/new` held the gateway mutex across `start_thread`, and the bridge's `/mcp`
//! call needed the same mutex to check a secret. A credential check is a
//! read-only string comparison; giving it its own lock means no spawn path,
//! present or future, can deadlock against a vendor's tool-face handshake.
//!
//! Lifecycle mirrors the session's, one state ahead of it:
//!
//! ```text
//! plan_*    reserve(sid, secret)  → Spawning   // the vendor may DISCOVER
//! apply_*   promote(sid)          → Live       // …and now USE
//! failure / stop_session          → forget     // the secret dies with it
//! ```
