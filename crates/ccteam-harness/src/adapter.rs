//! Harness adapter API shared by Claude/Codex execution adapters.
//!
//! ## What this file owns
//!
//! - The **new** [`HarnessAdapter`] trait (5 lifecycle async methods +
//!   routed turn submission + `name` + `vendor`)
//!   aligned with Codex `ThreadManager::{submit, next_event}` protocol.
//! - Cross-vendor types: [`AgentVendor`], [`ExecutionMode`], [`ThreadHandle`],
//!   [`TurnInput`], [`TurnId`], [`ThreadEvent`], [`ThreadItem`],
//!   [`ThreadItemDetails`], [`ThreadErrorEvent`], [`SpawnCtx`].
//! - [`UnifiedTokenUsage`] re-exported from `ccteam-cost`, the canonical
//!   pricing/cost definition.
//! - Legacy persistence + helper types still consumed by orchestrator /
//!   web / state.json registry: [`HarnessSnapshot`], [`SubagentState`],
//!   [`SpawnOpts`], [`SessionHandle`] (now an internal data type — no
//!   longer part of the trait surface).
//! - Free fns kept from V0.4.0 because callers outside this file still
//!   read state.json: [`parse_cc_state_json`], [`parse_pid_from_state`],
//!   [`state_json_path`], [`sigterm_pid`], [`sigkill_pid`],
//!   [`parse_backgrounded_short_id`], plus codex marker constants.
//!
//! Concrete adapter implementations still live in `ccteam-core` for
//! this slice; they move here after their progress/workflow coupling is
//! removed. Pure execution support modules already live under
//! [`crate::execution`].
//!
//! ## Red lines (unchanged from V0.5.x)
//!
//! - The snapshot pipeline is **presentation-only**. `progress.jsonl`
//!   remains the single source of truth for state transitions.
//! - `close_thread` is the **only** path that kills a long-running
//!   session, and it must be invoked exclusively from a user-initiated
//!   `ccteam session rm` (F49) — never silently.
//! - `ccteam-core` does not know team-name literals.
//!
//! ## Trait binding contract
//!
//! The trait signature below is **locked per minor version**. v0.6
//! (F107/F108/F112) settled the 5 lifecycle + 2 identifier methods;
//! v0.8.5 deliberately extends it once with `handle_directive` +
//! `thread_status` (both no-default — see the trait doc). Extending the
//! surface is a planned, doc-first event; drive-by signature changes
//! within a wave are not.
